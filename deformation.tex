\section{Computing in de~Rham cohomology}
\subsection{Computing the cohomology}
\label{sec:deRham}

In this section we recall how to compute in the algebraic de~Rham cohomology space 
$\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}/\mathfrak{S})$ of the complement $\mathfrak{U}/\mathfrak{S}$ 
of a family of smooth hypersurfaces $\mathfrak{X}/\mathfrak{S}$ contained in 
$\mathbf{P}^n_{\mathfrak{S}}$ following the method of Griffiths and Dwork. 
Actually, because we prefer to do linear algebra over a field, we will mainly work with 
the de Rham cohomology vector space $\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ of the generic fiber 
$\mathfrak{U}_L = \mathfrak{U}/\mathfrak{S} \times_{\mathfrak{S}} \Spec{L}$,
where $L=K(t)$ denotes the function field of $\mathfrak{S}$. 

\begin{thm}
Let $\Omega$ denote the $n$-form $\Omega$ in $\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ 
defined by 
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i x_i d x_0 \wedge \dotsb \wedge \widehat{d x_i} \wedge \dotsb \wedge d x_n.
\end{equation}
The algebraic de~Rham cohomology space $\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ is 
isomorphic as an $L$-vector space to the quotient of the space of closed $n$-forms 
$Q \Omega / P^k$, with $k \in \NN$ and $Q \in L[x_0, x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$ 
homogeneous of degree $k d - (n + 1)$, by the subspace of exact $n$-forms generated by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:deRhamRel}
\frac{(\partial_i Q) \Omega}{P^k} - k \frac{Q (\partial_i P) \Omega}{P^{k+1}},
\end{equation}
with $k \in \NN$ and $Q \in L[x_0, x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$ 
homogeneous of degree $kd-n$, where $\partial_i$ 
denotes the partial derivative operator with respect to~$x_i$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
See for example Griffiths~\citep[\S 4]{Griffiths1969}.
\end{proof}

The cohomology space $\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ is equipped with an 
increasing filtration of $L$-vector spaces $\{\mathcal{F}_k \HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L) \}_{k \geq 1}$ 
for which $\mathcal{F}_k \HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ consists of all elements that
can be represented by $n$-forms $Q \Omega / P^k$  with $Q \in L[x_0, x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$ 
homogeneous of degree $kd - (n + 1)$. It follows from a theorem of Macaulay~\citep[\S 4, (4.11)]{Griffiths1969} 
that $\mathcal{F}_n \HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)= \HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$. Therefore, a basis for 
$\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ can in principle be computed using (finite dimensional) linear algebra. 
However, we will define an explicit basis of a very simple form for $\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ for the
families that we are interested in.
%TODO perhaps mention that all spaces of polynomials contain Q=0 (annoying)
%TODO mention that F_i is the (reverse) Hodge filtration on H^{n-1}(X) with the correct indices

\begin{defn} \label{defn:MonBasis}
For $k \in \NN$, we define the following sets of monomials: 
\begin{align*}
F_k & = \{ x^i : i \in \mathbf{N}_{0}^{n+1}, \abs{i} = k d - (n+1) \}, \\
B_k & = \{ x^i : i \in \mathbf{N}_{0}^{n+1}, \abs{i} = k d - (n+1) \text{ and $i_j < d-1$ for $0 \leq j \leq n$}\},
\end{align*}
where $x^i = x_0^{i_0} \dotsm x_n^{i_n}$ and 
$\abs{i} = i_0 + \dotsb + i_n$. We write $\cB_k= \{Q \Omega / P^k : Q \in B_k\}$, $B = B_1 \cup \dotsc \cup B_n$, 
and $\cB = \cB_1 \cup \dotsc \cup \cB_n$.
\end{defn}

%TODO remark that B_k \subset F_k and B_k=0 for k > n

We will show below that if the family $\mathfrak{X}/{\mathfrak{S}}$ contains a diagonal fiber, 
then the set $\cB$ forms a basis for $\HdR^n(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ .

\begin{defn} \label{defn:IndexSets}
For $k \in \NN$, we define the following sets of monomials in 
$L[x_0, \dotsc, x_n]$.  Let $R_k = F_k - B_k$ be the set of monomials of 
total degree $kd-(n+1)$ and partial degree at least $d-1$ with respect to some 
of the $n+1$ variables.  Let $C_k^{(0)}$ be the set of monomials of total 
degree $(k-1)d - n$, and then inductively, for $j = 1, \dotsc, n$, define 
$C_k^{(j)}$ to be the set of monomials in $C_k^{(j-1)}$ except for those 
divisible by $x_{j-1}^{d-1}$.  Moreover, we define the multi-set $C_k$ as 
the disjoint union of $C_k^{(0)}, \dotsc, C_k^{(n)}$.  We shall write an 
element of this multi-set as $(j, g)$, when referring to a monomial~$g$ 
in~$C_k^{(j)}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:Isomorphism}
Suppose that the family $\mathfrak{X}/\mathfrak{S}$ of smooth projective
hypersurfaces given by the polynomial~$P$ in $K[t][x_0, \dotsc, x_n]$ contains 
a diagonal fibre.  For $k \in \NN$ and $0 \leq j \leq n$, let $V_k^{(j)}$ be 
the $L$-vector space of polynomials with basis $C_k^{(j)}$. Let $V_k$ denote the 
cartesian product $V_k = V_k^{(0)} \times \dotsb \times V_k^{(n)}$, and let $W_k$ be 
the $L$-vector space of polynomials with basis~$R_k$.  Then the map 
\begin{equation}
\phi_k \colon V_k \to W_k, 
(Q_0, \dotsc, Q_n) \mapsto Q_0 \partial_0 P + \dotsb + Q_n \partial_n P
\end{equation}
is an isomorphism of $L$-vector spaces.
\end{thm}
%TODO check whether having a diagonal fiber is necessary
%TODO! why is phi_k even well defined? 

\begin{proof}
We first show that, for all $k \in \NN$, the multi-sets $R_k$ and $C_k$ 
have the same cardinality.

We construct a bijection $R_k \to C_k$, representing the 
monomials by their exponent tuples.  Let $i = (i_0, \dotsc, i_n)$ be an
element of $R_k$.  If $i_0 \geq d-1$, we define the image as
$(i_0-d-1, i_1, \dotsc, i_n) \in C_k^{(0)}$.  More generally, if 
$i_0 < d-1, \dotsc, i_{j-1} < d-1$ and $i_j \geq d-1$, we define the image as 
$(i_0, \dotsc, i_{j-1}, i_j-(d-1), i_{j+1}, \dotsc, i_n) \in C_k^{(j)}$.  
It is easy to verify that this map is indeed a bijection.

If $R_k$ and $C_k$ are empty, then $V_k$ and $W_k$ are the zero vector spaces, and
the theorem holds trivially. So suppose that $R_k$ and $C_k$ are nonempty, that is to
say, $k \geq n/d + 1$.

In order to establish that the map $\phi_k \colon V_k \to W_k$ is an 
isomorphism of $L$-vector spaces, we look at its matrix with respect to 
the given bases. We define the auxiliary matrix $\Delta_k$ with 
row and column index sets $R_k$ and $C_k$, respectively, as follows.  
Given $f \in R_k$ and $(j,g) \in C_k$, we set the corresponding entry in 
$\Delta_k$ to be the coefficient of the monomial $f/g$ in $\partial_j P$ if 
$g$ divides $f$ and $0$ otherwise.  It is immediate that $\Delta_k$ is the 
matrix representing $\phi_k$ with respect to the bases $C_k$ and $R_k$ of 
$V_k$ and $W_k$, respectively.

The assumption that the family~$\mathfrak{X}/\mathfrak{S}$ contains a diagonal 
hypersurface means that for some~$t_0$ the fibre $\mathfrak{X}_{t_0}$ is 
defined by a polynomial of the form 
\begin{equation}
P_{t_0}(x_0, \dotsc, x_n) = a_0 x_0^d + \dotsb a_n x_n^d
\end{equation}
with $a_0, \dotsc, a_n \in K^{\times}$.

We can now show that the determinant of $\Delta_k$ is nonzero in~$L$.  Since 
specialisation to the diagonal fibre i.e., evaluation of the matrix at 
$t = t_0$, commutes with computing the determinant, it suffices to show that 
the determinant of $(\Delta_k) \big |_{t=t_0}$ is nonzero.
Since for $0 \leq j \leq n$, we have $\partial_j P_{t_0} (x_0, \dotsc, x_n) = d a_j x_j^{d-1}$, 
there is precisely one non-zero entry in each column and each row of $\Delta_k$:  in column 
$(j, g) \in C_k$ and row $g x_j^{d-1} \in R_k$ there is the non-zero entry 
$d \alpha_j$, concluding the proof. \end{proof}

We can use Theorem \ref{thm:Isomorphism} to give a routine {\sc Decompose} (formalised in
Algorithm \ref{alg:Decompose} below) which, 
given $Q \in L[x_0, \dotsc, x_n]$ homogeneous of degree $kd - (n+1)$, 
returns an expression 
\begin{equation}
Q = Q_0 \partial_0 P + \dotsb + Q_n \partial_n P + \gamma_k,
\end{equation} 
with $Q_0, \dotsc, Q_n \in L[x_0, \dotsc, x_n]$ homogeneous of degree $kd-n$ and 
$\gamma_k$ in the $L$-span of $B_k$. We can in turn use {\sc Decompose}
to furnish another routine {\sc Reduce} (formalised in Algorithm~\ref{alg:PoleRed} below) 
which, given a closed $n$-form $Q\Omega/P^k$ with $Q \in L[x_0, \dotsc, x_n]$ homogeneous 
of degree $kd - (n+1)$ returns an expression
\begin{equation}
Q \Omega / P^k \equiv \gamma_{1} \Omega / P^{1} + \dotsb + \gamma_n \Omega / P^n,
\end{equation}
with $\gamma_i$ in the $L$-span of $B_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$, and where $\equiv$ denotes 
equality in cohomology.

We now finally establish that the set $\cB$ indeed forms a basis for 
$\HdR^n(\mathfrak{U}_L)$, as announced before.

\begin{thm} \label{thm:Basis}
Suppose that the family of projective hypersurfaces $\mathfrak{X}/\mathfrak{S}$ 
contains a diagonal fibre.  Then the set $\cB$ from Definition~\ref{defn:MonBasis} 
is a basis for the $L$-vector space $\HdR^n(\mathfrak{U}_L)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We already know that $\HdR^n(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ is spanned by the classes of the 
$n$-forms $Q \Omega / P^k$ with $Q \in L[x_0, \dotsc, x_n]$ homogeneous of degree 
$kd - (n+1)$ for $k \in \NN$. Applying Algorithm ~\ref{alg:PoleRed}, we obtain an 
expression for the class of $Q \Omega / P^k$ as an $L$-linear combination of 
elements in $\cB$.  This shows that the set $\cB$ spans the vector space 
$\HdR^n(\mathfrak{U}_L)$.

%TODO fix this, argument is not complete
%include counting argument to show that cardinality of B is dimension of
%cohomology, so B is a basis (if possible comparing the dimensions of the graded
%parts, to show that B_k is a basis for F_k/F_{k-1} (so 'compatible' with the
%filtration).

%To see that the set $\cB$ is linearly independent, note that it contains only 
%monomials whose partial degrees are strictly less than $d-1$.  However, since 
%$P$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ and the family of hypersurfaces 
%contains a diagonal fibre, it follows that, for each $0 \leq i \leq n$, the 
%partial derivative $\partial_i P$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d-1$ 
%and contains precisely one monomial term with partial degree equal to $d-1$, 
%namely that of the monomial $x_i^{d-1}$.  It follows that the elements of~$B$ 
%cannot be reduced further modulo the Jacobian ideal and hence that the 
%set~$\cB$ is linearly independent.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Computing the connection matrix}
\label{sec:Connection}

We now describe the action of the Gauss--Manin connection~$\nabla$ on 
$\HdR^n(\mathfrak{U}_L)$.  Suppose that we are given a basis element 
$x^i \Omega / P^k \in \cB_k$.  Following the description in Section [], we compute
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:nabla}
\nabla \biggl(\frac{x^i \Omega}{P^k}\biggr) \equiv dt \otimes \frac{- k x^i P_t \Omega}{P^{k+1}},
\end{equation}
%TODO changed sign, should be right like this (because dt \wedge should be on the left)
where $P_t = dP/dt$ and $\equiv$ denotes equality in $\Omega_{L} \otimes \HdR^n(\mathfrak{U}_L)$. 
We apply Algorithm \ref{alg:PoleRed} in order to write
\begin{equation*}
dt \otimes \frac{- k x^i P_t \Omega}{P^{k+1}} \equiv 
dt \otimes \left( \frac{\gamma_{1}}{P} + \dotsb + \frac{\gamma_n}{P^n} \right) \Omega
\end{equation*}
where $\gamma_i$ is an element in the $L$-span of~$B_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. This is
formalised in Algorithm \ref{alg:Connection} below.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Compute the Gauss--Manin connection matrix}

\item For each $g \in B$, let $k=(\deg(g)+(n+1))/d$, and put $Q = - k g P_t$. Set 
      $\gamma_{1}, \dotsc, \gamma_n$ to the output of {\sc Reduce($P, B_1, \dotsc, B_n, Q$)}.  
      For each $f \in B$ let $M_{f,g}$ be the coefficient of $f$ in $\gamma_i$.
\item \textbf{return} $M$.

\section{Frobenius on diagonal hypersurfaces}
\label{sec:Diagonal}

\subsection{Introduction}

In this section we compute the action of Frobenius on the cohomology 
space $\Hrig^{n}(U_0) \cong \HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_0)$ associated 
to the diagonal fibre of the family. Our method is based on an 
explicit formula of Dwork~\citep[\S 4]{Dwork1964} that has already appeared
in the work of Lauder~\citep[\S 6]{Lauder2004b} and 
Gerkmann~\citep[\S 4.4]{Gerkmann2007}. However, by rewriting this formula 
a little, we obtain an algorithm that performs a lot better (in practice,
not asymptotically) than a more straightforward implementation.

In order to simplify our notation, we temporarily suppress the earlier 
setup of a family of hypersurfaces. Thus, we consider a single smooth 
projective diagonal hypersurface~$\mathcal{X}$ over $\ZZ_p$ defined by 
a polynomial $P \in \ZZ_p[x_0, \dotsc, x_n]$ of the form
\begin{equation}
P(x_0, x_1, \dotsc, x_n) = 
    a_0 x_0^d + a_1 x_1^d + \dotsb + a_n x_n^d
\end{equation}
where $a_0, a_1, \dotsc, a_n \in \ZZ_p^{\times}$ and $p \nmid d$.  
%TODO change p to q if this doesn't cause significant problems
We also define the generic fibre and the various complements as 
before.  We fix our choice of basis $\cB$ for $\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U})$ 
as in Definition~\ref{defn:MonBasis}, that is, $\cB = \cB_1 \cup \cdots \cup \cB_n$
with $\mathcal{B}_k  = \{x^i \Omega / P^k : x^i \in B_k \}$, where 
\begin{align}
B_k & = \{ x^i : \text{$\abs{i} = kd - (n+1)$ and $0 \leq i_j < d-1$, for all $j$} \},
\end{align}
and we denote $B = B_1 \cup \cdots \cup B_n$.

Finally, we recall the assumption that $d \geq 2$ whenever $n$ is 
odd and $d \geq 3$ whenever $n$ is even.  Our goal is to compute 
the matrix~$\Phi$ representing the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ on 
$\Hrig^n(U) \cong \HdR^n(\mathfrak{U})$, with respect to the basis
$\cB$, to $p$-adic precision~$N$.

We first describe an explicit formula for the $\dim \HdR^n(\mathfrak{U})$ 
non-zero coefficients of~$\Phi$ due to Dwork~\citep{Dwork1964}. 
% see e.g.\ Lauder~\citep[\S 6.1]{Lauder2004b}.   
We work over the ramified extension~$\QQ_p(\pi)$ where $\pi^{p-1} = -p$, 
and normalise the valuation such that \mbox{$\ord_p(\pi) = (p-1)^{-1}$}.

Let $u = (u_0, \dotsc, u_n)$ and $v = (v_0, \dotsc, v_n)$ be tuples of integers such 
that $x^u, x^v \in B$,  and let $k_u$ and $k_v$ 
denote integers such that $d k_u = \sum_{i=0}^n (u_i + 1)$ and similarly 
for $k_v$.  For $m \geq 0$, let $\lambda_m$ denote the coefficient 
of $z^m$ in the power series expansion of $\exp \pi (z - z^p)$ and define 
products $(w)_r = \prod_{j=0}^{r-1} (w + j)$ for $w \in \QQ$ and $r \geq 0$. 
We introduce terms~$\alpha_{u,v}$, 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:alpha}
\alpha_{u,v} = \pi^{k_v - k_u} \prod_{i = 0}^n \sum_{m, r} \lambda_m (u_i / d)_r (-1)^r \pi^{-r} {\hat{a}_i}^{m-r}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{a}_i \in \ZZ_p$ denotes the Teichm\"uller lift of $a_i \in \mathbf{F}_p$ 
and the summation indices $m, r \geq 0$ satisfy $p u_i - v_i = d (m - pr)$.

\begin{thm} \label{thm:01-03-diagfrob}
Let $\omega_1$ denote an element of $\cB$ corresponding to a tuple $u \in \ZZ^{n+1}$,
and let $\omega_2$ denote the unique element of $\cB$ corresponding to 
a tuple $v \in \ZZ^{n+1}$ such that for all $i = 0, \dotsc, n$ we have 
$p (u_i + 1) \equiv v_i + 1 \pmod{d}$. Then
\begin{equation}
p^{-1} \Frob_p (\omega_1) = 
    (-1)^{k_u + k_v} \frac{(k_v - 1)!}{(k_u - 1)!} p^n \alpha_{u+1,v+1}^{-1} \omega_2
\end{equation}
where $u + 1 = (u_0 + 1, \dotsc, u_n + 1)$ and similarly for $v + 1$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
See Dwork~\citep[\S 4]{Dwork1964} or 
%TODO take out reference to Lauder if Dwork reference is readable
Lauder~\citep[\S 6.1]{Lauder2004b}.  Both references also treat the 
more general case when $\mathcal{X}$ is a smooth projective 
diagonal hypersurface over $\ZZ_q$, for $q$ a prime power.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Improvements}

At first sight it appears that this computation genuinely has to take place in 
the extension field $\QQ_p(\pi)$.  This is, however, not the case 
as we will show now.  The terms $\alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ will turn out to be elements 
of $\ZZ_p$. We provide expressions for them that are more suitable
for computations.

First, it is easy to obtain a more explicit description of the 
coefficients~$\lambda_m$ via an elementary calculation:

\begin{lem} \label{lem:lambdam}
Let $\pi^{p-1} = -p$ and, for $m \geq 0$, let $\lambda_m$ 
be the coefficient of $z^m$ in the power series expansion 
of $\exp \pi (z - z^p)$ in $\QQ_p[[z]]$.  Then 
\begin{equation}
\pi^{- (m \bmod{(p-1)})} \lambda_m = (-1)^{\floor{m/(p-1)}} \sum_{k=0}^{\floor{m/p}} p^{\floor{m/(p-1)} - k} \frac{1}{(m-pk)! k!}
\end{equation}
where $m \bmod{(p-1)}$ denotes the remainder of $m$ upon Euclidean 
division by $p-1$. \hfill $\qedsymbol$
\end{lem}

We can apply this lemma in conjunction with the definition 
of the quantities $\alpha_{u+1, v+1}$.  Upon observing that 
$m - r \bmod{(p-1)}$ only depends on $u$ and $v$, we obtain the 
following theorem:

\begin{thm} \label{thm:alpha}
Let $u, v \in \ZZ^{n+1}$ be such that 
$x^u, x^v \in B$ and 
$p (u_i + 1) \equiv v_i + 1 \pmod{d}$ for all~$i$. 
Then 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{u+1,v+1} = (-p)^{k_u} \prod_{i=0}^n 
    \hat{a}_i^{(p (u_i + 1) - (v_i + 1))/d} \sum_{m,r} 
    \Bigl(\frac{u_i+1}{d}\Bigr)_r 
    \sum_{k=0}^{\floor{m/p}} \frac{p^{r-k}}{(m-pk)! k!}.
\end{equation}
where $m, r \geq 0$ satisfy $p (u_i + 1) - (v_i + 1) = d (m - pr)$.
\hfill \qedsymbol
\end{thm}
%TODO perhaps put proof back in, not that easy?

In particular, Theorem~\ref{thm:alpha} implies that 
$\alpha_{u+1, v+1} \in \QQ_p$.  Our next aim is to show
that $\alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ is integral.  First, we collect a few 
intermediate results.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:mpr1}
Let $x^u, x^v \in B$ and 
$m, r \geq 0$ such that $d(m-pr) = p(u_i + 1) - (v_i + 1)$ for all $i$.  Then 
\begin{equation*}
0 \leq m - p r \leq \frac{p(d-1)-1}{d}.
\end{equation*}
%TODO rewrite next line if we need it, m is already assumed to be >=0

%In particular, $m = m(r) = pr + d^{-1}\bigl(p(u_i+1)-(v_i+1)\bigr) \geq 0$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
This can be easily verified using that $0 \leq u_i, v_i \leq d - 2$ 
and $m - pr \in \ZZ$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:mpr2}
Let $x^u, x^v \in B$
and $m, r \geq 0$ such that $d(m-pr) = p(u_i + 1) - (v_i + 1)$ for all $i$.  Then 
\begin{equation*}
r - \floor{\frac{m}{p}} \geq 0.
\end{equation*}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Using the previous proposition,
\begin{equation*}
r - \floor{\frac{m}{p}} 
= - \floor{\frac{m-pr}{p}} 
\geq - \floor{\frac{p(d-1)-1}{pd}} 
= -1 + \ceil{\frac{p + 1}{pd}} 
= 0 
\end{equation*}
as $p \geq 2$ and $d \geq 2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:rfac}
For all integers $u, d \geq 1$ and $r \geq 0$ with $p \nmid d$, 
\begin{equation*}
\ord_p\Bigl(\frac{u}{d}\Bigr)_r \geq \frac{r}{p-1} - \floor{\log_p(r) + 1}.
\end{equation*}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $s_p(r)$ denote the sum of digits in the $p$-adic expansion of~$r$ 
and observe that $s_p(r) \leq (p-1)\floor{\log_p(r) + 1}$.  Using the standard fact that 
$\ord_p\bigl((u/d)_r\bigr) \geq \ord_p(r!)$, 
%from Clark~\citep[p.~265]{Clark1966} 
it follows that 
\begin{equation*}
\ord_p\Bigl(\frac{u}{d}\Bigr)_r \geq \ord_p(r!) = \frac{r - s_p(r)}{p-1} \geq \frac{r}{p-1} - \floor{\log_p(r) + 1}
\end{equation*}
as required.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{The case $p = 2$}

We first note that in the case when $p = 2$, the expression for 
$\lambda_m$ in Lemma~\ref{lem:lambdam} can be simplified.

\begin{lem} \label{lem:mu2}
For $p = 2$ we define a sequence $\bigl(\mu_m^{(2)}\bigr)$ by 
\begin{equation}
\mu_m^{(2)} = 
    \sum_{k=0}^{\floor{m/2}} \frac{2^{\floor{3m/4} - \nu_m - k}}{(m-2k)! k!}
\end{equation}
where $\nu_m$ is equal to one whenever $m = 3, 7$ and zero otherwise, 
and we write $\mu_m =\mu_m^{(2)}$ whenever this does not cause confusion. 
Then $\mu_m \in \ZZ_2$ for all $m \geq 0$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
In the two cases $m = 3, 7$ we explicitly compute the values of 
$\mu_m$ as $4/3$ and $232/315$.  Now suppose that $m \neq 3, 7$. 
From Lemma~\ref{lem:lambdam} we obtain that 
\begin{equation*}
\ord_2 \bigl(\mu_m\bigr) 
    = \floor{3m/4} - m + \ord_2(\lambda_m).
\end{equation*}
Using the bound $\ord_p(\lambda_m) \geq \bigl((p-1)/p^2\bigr) m$ from 
Dwork~\citep[pp.~55--57]{Dwork1962}, we obtain the lower bound 
\begin{equation*}
\ord_2 \bigl(\mu_m\bigr) 
    \geq \floor{3m/4} - m + \ceil{\frac{m}{4}} = 0. \qedhere
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:alpha2}
Let $p = 2$ and suppose $u, v \in \ZZ^{n+1}$ are such that 
$x^u, x^v \in B$ and  
$p (u_i + 1) \equiv v_i + 1 \pmod{d}$ for all~$i$.  Then $\alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ 
can be expressed as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:alpha2.0}
\alpha_{u+1,v+1} = (-2)^{k_u} \prod_{i=0}^n \sum_{m,r} 
    \Bigl(\frac{u_i+1}{d}\Bigr)_r 2^{-\floor{(m+1)/4}+\nu_m} \mu_m, 
\end{equation}
and $\alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ is a $2$-adic integer.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The expression for $\alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ is an immediate consequence 
of Theorem~\ref{thm:alpha} and Lemma~\ref{lem:mu2}, together with 
Proposition~\ref{prop:mpr1} implying $0 \leq m - 2r \leq 1$ and 
hence $r = \floor{m/2}$.  It remains to prove that 
$\alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ is a $2$-adic integer.  Following Lemma~\ref{lem:mu2}, 
it suffices to show that the valuation of the factor 
\begin{equation*}
\Bigl(\frac{u_i+1}{d}\Bigr)_r 2^{- \floor{(m+1)/4} + \nu_m}
\end{equation*}
in each summand is non-negative.  From the proof of 
Proposition~\ref{prop:rfac} we obtain that 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:alpha2.1}
\ord_p \biggl( \Bigl(\frac{u_i+1}{d}\Bigr)_r 2^{- \floor{(m+1)/4} + \nu_m} \biggr)
\geq \ord_p\Bigl(\floor{\frac{m}{2}}!\Bigr) - \floor{\frac{m+1}{4}} + \nu_m.
\end{equation}
Applying Proposition~\ref{prop:rfac}, we see that the right-hand side 
is bounded below by 
\begin{equation}
\floor{\frac{m}{2}} - \floor{\frac{m+1}{4}} - \floor{\log_2 m}
\end{equation}
which is nonnegative whenever $m \geq 12$.  In the remaining 
cases $m = 0, \dotsc, 11$, we explicitly verify that the 
lower bound in~\eqref{eq:alpha2.1} is nonnegative.
%TODO k_u \geq 1, so to show alpha is integral you need less 
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
\begin{rem}
We observe that in equation~\eqref{eq:alpha2.0} the exponent 
$-\floor{(m+1)/4}+\nu_m$ is nonpositive for each value $m \geq 0$, 
which suggests the computational question of how to determine the 
sequence of factors 
\begin{equation*}
\Bigl(\frac{u_i+1}{d}\Bigr)_r 2^{- \floor{(m+1)/4} + \nu_m}
\end{equation*}
to $2$-adic precision $\tilde{N}$ without intermediate precision loss.
Changing our notation slightly, suppose we wish to compute the sequence
\begin{equation*}
f_r = 2^{- \floor{(m+1)/4} + \nu_m} \prod_{j=0}^{r-1} (u + j d)
\end{equation*}
for all $r \geq 0$, where $m(r) = m(0) + 2r$, $m(0) \in \{0,1\}$, 
$u$ is a positive integer and $d$ is a positive odd integer.
Explicitly, we find that this sequence satisfies 
\begin{align*}
f_0 & = 1, \\
f_1 & = u, \\
f_5 & = \begin{cases}
        \displaystyle \tfrac{1}{4} u (u + d) (u + 2d) (u + 3d) (u + 4d)
            & \text{if $m(0)=0$,} \\
        \displaystyle \tfrac{1}{8} u (u + d) (u + 2d) (u + 3d) (u + 4d)
            & \text{otherwise,}
        \end{cases} \\
f_r & = f_{r-2} \frac{(u + (r - 2)d)(u + (r - 1)d)}{2}
\end{align*}
for all remaining $r \geq 0$.  Since the product in the numerator is 
an even integer, it is clear that this computation can be carried 
out without precision loss despite reducing previous values of~$f_r$ 
modulo~$p^{\tilde{N}}$.
\end{rem}
\end{comment}

\subsubsection{The case $p \neq 2$}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:mup}
Let $p \geq 3$ be an odd prime and define a sequence 
$\bigl(\mu_m^{(p)}\bigr)$ by 
\begin{equation}
\mu_m^{(p)} = \sum_{k=0}^{\floor{m/p}} \frac{p^{\floor{m/p} - k}}{(m-pk)! k!}, 
\end{equation}
where we write $\mu_m = \mu_m^{(p)}$ when the prime can be identified 
from the context.  Then $\mu_m \in \ZZ_p$ for all $m \geq 0$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that $\mu_m \in \QQ$.  From Lemma~\ref{lem:lambdam} 
we observe that $\lambda_m = \pi^m p^{- \floor{m/p}} \mu_m$.  Using the 
bound $\ord_p(\lambda_m) \geq \bigl((p-1)/p^2\bigr) m$ 
from Dwork~\citep[pp.~55--57]{Dwork1962}, it follows that 
\begin{equation}
\ord_p (\mu_m) \geq \frac{p-1}{p^2} m + \floor{\frac{m}{p}} - \frac{m}{p-1}.
\end{equation}
Let us write $m = q p + r$ with $0 \leq r \leq p-1$.  As the valuation 
of $\mu_m$ is an integer, it suffices to show that, for $q \geq 0$, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{p-1}{p} q + q - \frac{q p + p - 1}{p - 1} > -1,
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to $p^2 - 3p + 1 > 0$, and this holds true 
provided that $p \geq 3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:alphap}
Let $p \geq 3$ and suppose that $u, v \in \ZZ^{n+1}$ are such 
that $x^u, x^v \in B$ and 
$p (u_i + 1) \equiv v_i + 1 \pmod{d}$ for all $i$. Then 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:alphap.0}
\alpha_{u+1,v+1} = (-p)^{k_u} \prod_{i=0}^n 
    \hat{a}_i^{(p (u_i + 1) - (v_i + 1))/d} \sum_{m,r} 
    \Bigl(\frac{u_i+1}{d}\Bigr)_r p^{r - \floor{m/p}} \mu_m
\end{equation}
where $m, r \geq 0$ satisfy $p (u_i + 1) - (v_i + 1) = d (m - pr)$. 
In particular, $\alpha_{u+1, v+1} \in \ZZ_p$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:alpha}, Proposition~\ref{prop:mpr2} 
and Lemma~\ref{lem:mup}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Description of the algorithm}

%TODO replace \tilde{N} by N if there's no other N in this section
Up to this point, the double sum over $m,r$ in our expressions 
for $\alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ has been an infinite sum.  We now present 
a convergence result, which will allow us to derive a finite 
expression for $\alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ modulo $p^{\tilde{N}}$.

\begin{lem} \label{lem:log}
Given integers $b,c \geq 2$ and defining $x = c + \log_b c + 1$ 
we have that, for all real numbers $y \geq x$, 
\begin{equation}
y - \log_b y \geq c.
\end{equation}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We first note that the function $y \mapsto y - \log_b y$ is increasing 
for $y \geq 2$ because it has derivative $1 - \log_b(e)/y > 0$.  Thus, it 
suffices to verify the result for $x$.  Indeed, as $c \geq 2$ we have 
that $\log_b c + 1 \leq c$, hence $c + \log_b c + 1 \leq b^{\log_b c + 1}$,
which upon taking logarithms and rearranging yields the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
In order to compute $\alpha_{u+1,v+1} \bmod p^{\tilde{N}}$ it 
suffices to restrict the inner sum to pairs $m,r \geq 0$ such 
that $m \leq M = M(\tilde{N}, p)$ where 
\begin{equation}
M = \floor{ p^2 \biggl( \frac{\tilde{N}}{p-1} 
            + \log_p\Bigl(\frac{\tilde{N}}{p-1} + 2\Bigr) + 3 \biggr) }.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
This follows from~\citep[\S 6.2]{Lauder2004b} and Lemma~\ref{lem:log}.
%TODO check this in Lauder's paper
\end{proof}

Finally, we describe how to compute an approximation to the matrix~$\Phi$ 
representing the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ on $\Hrig^{n}(U)$ using our 
previous results.

\begin{prop}
The valuation of $(k_u-1)! \alpha_{u+1,v+1}$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\ord_p\bigl((k_u-1)! \alpha_{u+1,v+1}\bigr) 
    \leq \ord_p\bigl((n-1)!\bigr) + n + \delta
\end{equation}
where $\delta = \ord_p\bigl((n-1)!\bigr) + (n+1) \floor{\log_p(n-1)}$. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Recall from Gerkmann~\citep[Lemma~3.3]{Gerkmann2007} that the valuations 
of the entries of the matrix~$\Phi$ are bounded from below by $-\delta$. 
Thus, by Theorem~\ref{thm:01-03-diagfrob}, 
\begin{equation}
-\delta \leq \ord_p\bigl((k_v-1)!\bigr) + n 
           - \ord_p\bigl((k_u-1)! \alpha_{u+1,v+1}\bigr)
\end{equation}
Noting that $d k_v = \sum_{i=0}^n (v_i + 1) \leq n d$ and 
hence $k_v \leq n$, the result follows.
\end{proof}

This allows us to formalise the procedure for computing the 
entries of~$\Phi$ modulo~$p^N$ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:Diabfrob} 
below.

\begin{algorithm}

    & \text{if $p$ is odd},
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
using only one $p$-adic inversion.  We observe that the summands are 
integers of size $\BigOh(m \log m)$ bits, which also allows us to 
avoid performing intermediate reductions modulo~$p^{\tilde{N}}$.

%TODO put all the complexity stuff together at the end, and max a couple
%of pages total
\begin{comment}
\begin{thm} \label{thm:DiagfrobComplexity1}
The time complexity of Algorithm~\ref{alg:Diabfrob} is given by 
\begin{equation*}
p \tilde{N}^2 \cM\bigl(p \tilde{N} \log (p \tilde{N})\bigr)
    + d^n n \bigl( \cM(\log d) + (\tilde{N} + \log p) \cM(\tilde{N} \log p) \bigr)
\end{equation*}
where $\cM(-)$ denotes the complexity of integer multiplication and 
$\tilde{N}$ is $\BigOh(N + n \log_p n)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We consider each of the steps in Algorithm~\ref{alg:Diabfrob}. 
We can ignore the computational cost of {Step~(i)}, but observe 
that $\tilde{N} \in \BigOh(N + n \log_p n)$, 
$M \in \BigOh(p \tilde{N})$, and $R \in \BigOh(\tilde{N})$.  

In {Step~(ii)}, we compute $n+1$ Teichm\"uller lifts with an 
overall complexity of $\BigOh(n (\log p) \cM(\tilde{N} \log p))$. 
The computation of the sequence $(d^{-r})_{r=0}^{R}$ requires 
one reduction of $d$ modulo $p^{\tilde{N}}$, one $p$-adic inversion 
and $R-1$~products to precision~$\tilde{N}$, yielding 
$\BigOh\bigl(\cM(\log d) + (\log \log p) \cM(\log p) + \tilde{N} \cM(\tilde{N} \log p)\bigr)$. 
Finally, we carry out the computation of $(\mu_m)_{m=0}^{M}$ following 
Remark~\ref{rem:mup}, which requires time 
$\BigOh\bigl(p \tilde{N}^2 \cM(p \tilde{N} \log(p \tilde{N}))\bigr)$.

The following {Steps~(iii) through (vii)} are executed 
$\dim \Hrig^{n}(U)$ times, where this dimension 
is $\BigOh(d^n)$.
The time complexity of {Step~(iii)} is 
$\BigOh\bigl(n \cM(\log \max\{p,d\})\bigr)$.
We observe that we can ignore {Step~(iv)}.
Step~(v) involves an $(n+1)$-fold product of series 
with~$\BigOh(R)$ terms modulo~$p^{\tilde{N}}$, where each summand 
requires an absolutely bounded number of products, as well as 
$n+1$~exponentiations of Teichm\"uller lifts with exponents given 
by $d^{-1} \bigl(p (u_i+1) - (v_i+1)\bigr) < p$.  Computing the 
exponents has complexity $\BigOh(\cM(\log \max\{p,d\}))$ and 
we note that we may ignore the update of the term 
\mbox{$\bigl((u_i+1)/d\bigr)_r$} throughout the summation 
assuming we have computed the reduction of $d \bmod{p^{\tilde{N}}}$ 
once and for all earlier.  Therefore, the complexity of each 
invocation of {Step~(v)} is 
$\BigOh\bigl( n \cM(\log d) + n (R + \log p) \cM(\tilde{N} \log p)\bigr)$.  
The $p$-adic inverse in {Step~(vi)} requires time 
$\BigOh\bigl((\log \log p) \cM(\log p) + \cM(\tilde{N} \log p)\bigr)$.
Finally, we can ignore the product in {Step~(vii)}.  
Thus, the aggregate time complexity of {Steps~(iii)} through {(vii)} 
is given by 
$\BigOh\bigl(d^n n \bigl( \cM(\log d) + (\tilde{N} + \log p) \cM(\tilde{N} \log p) \bigr)\bigr)$.
\end{proof}

While the current implementation of Algorithm~\ref{alg:Diabfrob} 
performs very well in practice, its time complexity is quasi-cubic in 
the $p$-adic precision~$N$, which is \emph{not} optimal.  Both of 
these aspects are due to the use of the sequence $(\mu_m)_{m=0}^{M}$ 
defined over $\ZZ_p$ instead of the coefficients $(\lambda_m)_{m=0}^{M}$ 
defined over $\QQ_p(\pi)$.  We can achieve a better time complexity by 
utilising fast exponentials of power series:

\begin{thm} \label{thm:DiagfrobComplexity2}
There exists an algorithm for computing the matrix for the 
action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ on $\Hrig^{n}(U)$ in time complexity 
\begin{equation*}
(M \log M \log \log M) (p \log p) \cM(\tilde{N} \log p) 
+ d^n n \bigl( \cM(\log d) 
              + \tilde{N} (p \log p) \cM(\tilde{N} \log p) \bigr)
\end{equation*}
where $\cM(-)$ denotes the complexity of integer multiplication 
and $\tilde{N} \in \BigOh(N + n \log_p n)$, $M \in \BigOh(p \tilde{N})$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The key idea is to slightly modify Algorithm~\ref{alg:Diabfrob} 
and use equation~\eqref{eq:alpha}, working directly with the sequence 
$(\lambda_m)_{m=0}^{M}$.  As we will be using operations in the 
totally ramified extension~$\QQ_p(\pi)$ to 
$p$-adic precision~$\tilde{N}$, we remark that the cost of 
an arithmetic operation in its ring of integers is 
$\BigOh\bigl((p \log p) \cM(\tilde{N} \log p)\bigr)$, 
achieved by polynomial multiplication based on the fast Fourier 
transform.

We first observe that the valuation of the summands in 
equation~\eqref{eq:alpha} can be bounded by 
$\ord_p \bigl(\lambda_m (u_i / d)_r (-1)^r \pi^{-r} {\hat{a}_i}^{m-r} \bigr) \geq - 1/2$.
As the only term with negative valuation is $\pi^{-r}$ and 
$R \in \BigOh(\tilde{N})$, it suffices to precompute 
the sequences $(\lambda_m)_{m=0}^{M}$ and $(d^{-r})_{r=0}^{R}$ 
to $p$-adic precision $\tilde{N}$.  While the computation 
of the latter remains unchanged, the computation of the former 
can be improved significantly using fast exponentials of 
power series in $\QQ_p(\pi)[[z]]$ as described by 
Bernstein~\citep[\S 9.3]{Bernstein2008}.  This allows for 
computing the sequence $(\lambda_m)_{m=0}^{M}$ in 
$\BigOh\bigl( (M \log M \log \log M) \bigr)$ operations 
in~$\QQ_p(\pi)$ to precision~$\tilde{N}$.  The only 
remaining change to our analysis of Algorithm~\ref{alg:Diabfrob} 
occurs in {Step~(v)}, where for each matrix entry we have to consider 
$\BigOh(n R)$ multiplications in~$\QQ_p(\pi)$ instead 
of~$\ZZ_p$.

\section{Solving the differential equation}
\label{sec:DifferentialSystem}

In this section we describe how to solve the $p$-adic differential 
system governed by the Gauss--Manin connection in order to obtain 
a local expansion of the matrix for the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ 
on $\Hrig^{n}(U/S)$.  Our discussion largely follows the work of 
Lauder~\citep{Lauder2006}.

Recall that $\Phi$ denotes the matrix for the $\sigma$-semilinear action 
of~$p^{-1} \Frob_p$ on $\Hrig^{n}(U/S)$, where $\sigma$ is the standard lift 
of the $p$th-power Frobenius to~$\mathbf{Q}_q$ and~$\mathbf{Q}_q(t)$ sending 
$t \mapsto t^p$, and $M$ the matrix for the Leibniz-linear connection on 
$\HdR^n(\mathfrak{U}/\mathfrak{S})$.
As we saw before, these matrices satisfy the following differential system,
\begin{equation}
\Bigl(\frac{d}{dt} + M\Bigr) \Phi = p t^{p-1} \Phi \sigma(M).
\end{equation}
Our goal is the computation of a power series expansion of~$\Phi$ around 
the origin, satisfying the above differential equation and the initial 
condition that~$\Phi_0$ be the matrix for the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ 
on $\Hrig^n(U_0)$.  We begin by observing that, upon setting 
\begin{equation}
\Phi = C \Phi_0 \sigma(C)^{-1},
\end{equation}
the above differential system is equivalent to the homogeneous system 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:01-GMDE-Homogenous}
\Bigl(\frac{d}{dt} + M\Bigr) C = 0
\end{equation}
with the initial condition that $C(0)$ is the identity matrix.  Let us write 
\begin{equation}
M(t) = \frac{B(t)}{r(t)}
\end{equation}
where $B(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{\deg(B)} B_i t^i$ is a matrix over $\mathbf{Q}[t]$ 
with $\deg(B) = \max_{i,j} \deg(B_{ij})$ and $r(t) \in \mathbf{Z}[t]$ is the 
\emph{Macaulay resultant} for the polynomial~$P$.  We can now obtain a 
power series solution $C(t) = \sum_{i \geq 0} C_i t^i$ around $t=0$ for 
\begin{equation}
r(t) \frac{dC}{dt} + B(t) C(t) = 0
\end{equation}
using the recursion 
\begin{equation}
C_{i+1} = \frac{-1}{r_0 (i+1)} \biggl(
    \sum_{j=\max{\{0,i-\deg(B)\}}}^i B_{i-j} C_j + 
    \sum_{j=\max{\{0,i-\deg(r)\}}+1}^i r_{i-j+1} j C_j \biggr).
\end{equation}
where we recall that by assumption $r_0 \neq 0 \pmod{p}$ and so, 
in particular, $r_0 \neq 0$.  [[TODO:  Reference where we place 
the assumption.]]

From a computational perspective, we are only interested in a power 
series solution to some $p$-adic and $t$-adic precisions $N$ and $K_2$, 
respectively, as discussed in the next two sections.  As such we need 
to understand the loss of $p$-adic precision involved in the computation 
of $C_0, C_1, \dotsc, C_{K_2-1}$.  Specifically, let $D_0, D_1, \dotsc$ 
denote an approximation defined by $D_0 = I$ and 
\begin{equation*}
D_{i+1} = \frac{-1}{r_0 (i+1)} \biggl(
    \sum_{j=\max{\{0,i-\deg(B)\}}}^i B_{i-j} D_j + 
    \sum_{j=\max{\{0,i-\deg(r)\}}+1}^i r_{i-j+1} j D_j \biggr) + 
    p^{\tilde{N}} E_{i+1},
\end{equation*}
where $(E_i)_{i \geq 1}$ is a sequence of $p$-adically integral matrices. 

The relationship between the desired precision~$N$ and the working 
precision~$\tilde{N}$ is described by Lauder~\citep[Theorem~5.1]{Lauder2006}, 
but this can be improved significantly by including recent bounds on the 
valuation of $C_0, C_1, \dotsc$ by Kedlaya~\citep{Kedlaya2010}.

\begin{thm} \label{thm:valC}
For all $i \geq 0$, the $p$-adic valuation of the matrix~$C_i$ 
can be bounded by 
\begin{equation}
\ord_p(C_i) \geq - \bigl(2 \delta + (n - 1)\bigr) \ceil{\log_p i}.
\end{equation}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let us recall from Lemma~[[TODO: Reference]] that 
$\ord_p(\Phi) \geq -\delta$, and hence $\ord_p(p^{n-1}\Phi^{-1}) \geq -\delta$ 
by Poincar\'e duality.  Thus, we see that 
\begin{equation}
\ord_p(\Phi) + \ord_p(\Phi^{-1}) \geq - 2 \delta - (n-1)
\end{equation}
and the bound follows now from Theorem~{18.3.3} by 
Kedlaya~\citep{Kedlaya2010}.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
Kedlaya~\citep[Remark~18.3.4]{Kedlaya2010} also includes another bound,
\begin{equation}
\ord_p(C_i) \geq (b - 1) \ord_p(M) 
            - \bigl(2 \delta + (n - 1)\bigr) \floor{\log_p i},
\end{equation}
which is better than the estimate used in the previous theorem whenever 
$\ord_p(M)$ is positive.
\end{rem}

\begin{thm}
Let the sequences of matrices $(C_i)$ and $(D_i)$ over $\mathbf{Q}$ and 
$\mathbf{Q}_p$, respectively, be defined as above.  Then, for all $i \geq 0$, 
\begin{equation*}
\ord_p(C_i - D_i) \geq 
    \tilde{N} - \Bigl(2 \bigl(2 \delta + (n-1)\bigr) + 1\Bigr) \ceil{\log_p i}.
\end{equation*}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
This follows analogously to the result of 
Lauder~\citep[Theorem~5.1]{Lauder2006}.  
Indeed, its proof shows more specifically that 
\begin{equation}
\ord_p(C_i - D_i) \geq 
    \tilde{N} + \min_{k+\ell=i} \Bigl(\ord_p(C_k) + 
                                      \ord_p(\ell^{-1} C_{\ell-1}^{-1})\Bigr).
\end{equation}
We use the bound from Theorem~\ref{thm:valC} and observe that they 
also apply to the inverse matrix~$C^{-1}$, as this matrix satisfies 
the related differential equation 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:01-GMDE-Dual}
\Bigl(\frac{d}{dt} - M^t\Bigr) \bigl(C^{-1}\bigr)^t = 0.
\end{equation}
The result now follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
In order to determine the power series expansion of the matrix~$\Phi$, 
we also need to compute the matrix $\sigma(C)^{-1}$.  As we assume that 
the family~$\mathcal{X}$ of hypersurfaces is defined over $\mathbf{Z}_p$, 
the connection matrix~$M$ is a matrix over $\mathbf{Q}_p[t,r(t)^{-1}]$ 
and the local solution~$C$ has entries in~$\mathbf{Q}_p[[t]]$.  
As $\sigma$ acts trivially on~$\mathbf{Q}_p$, we have that 
$\sigma(C)^{-1} = C(t^p)^{-1} = C^{-1}(t^p)$. 

The matrix~$C^{-1}$ could be computed using matrix inversion 
over the ring $\mathbf{Q}_p[[t]]$.  An alternative approach 
follows from observing that whenever $C$ satisfies 
equation~\eqref{eq:01-GMDE-Homogenous}, its inverse~$C^{-1}$ 
satisfies the related differential equation~\eqref{eq:01-GMDE-Dual}. 
In practice, solving this equation for $C^{-1}$ is typically favourable 
compared to inverting the matrix~$C$.
\end{rem}

With $p$-adic approximations to the power series modulo $t^{K_2}$ available 
for $C$, $\Phi_0$, and $\sigma(C)^{-1}$, we are in a position to determine 
the power series for $\Phi = C \Phi_0 \sigma(C)^{-1}$.  The final issue 
to address in this section is the $p$-adic precision that we require for 
the three matrices $C$, $\Phi_0$, and $C^{-1}$.
We begin by developing generic bounds on the products of $p$-adic numbers 
and matrices.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:productval}
Let $x_1, \dotsc, x_{\ell} \in \mathbf{Q}_p$, where $\ell \geq 2$, 
be given as $x_i = p^{v_i} u_i$ with $v_i = \ord_p(x_i) \in \mathbf{Z}$ 
and $u_i \in \mathbf{Z}_p^{\times}$ whenever $x_i \neq 0$ and 
$u_i = v_i = 0$ otherwise.  Suppose that $N \in \mathbf{Z}$ is given 
such that $N > \sum_{j=1}^{\ell} v_j$ and, for all $i$, $N > \sum_{j \neq i} v_j$.

Let $\tilde{x}_1, \dotsc, \tilde{x}_{\ell}$ be $p$-adic approximations 
satisfying $\ord_p(x_i - \tilde{x}_i) \geq N - \sum_{j \neq i} v_j$ 
for all $i$.  Then 
\begin{equation}
\ord_p(x_1 \dotsm x_{\ell} - \tilde{x}_1 \dotsm \tilde{x}_{\ell}) \geq N.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The proof is straightforward, relying only on elementary properties on 
the $p$-adic valuation on $\mathbf{Q}_p$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:matrixproductval}
Let $A_1, \dotsc, A_{\ell}$ be $b \times b$ matrices over $\mathbf{Q}_p$, 
where $\ell \geq 2$, given as $A_i = p^{v_i} U_i$ with 
$v_i = \ord_p(A_i) \in \mathbf{Z}$ and at least one entry of $U_i$ a 
$p$-adic unit $A_i \neq 0$ and $v_i = 0$ and $U_i$ the zero matrix 
otherwise.  Suppose that $N \in \mathbf{Z}$ is given such that 
$N > \sum_{j=1}^{\ell} v_j$ and, for all $i$, $N > \sum_{j \neq i} v_j$.

Let $\tilde{A}_1, \dotsc, \tilde{A}_{\ell}$ be $p$-adic approximations 
satisfying $\ord_p(A_i - \tilde{A}_i) \geq N - \sum_{j \neq i} v_j$ 
for all $i$.  Then 
\begin{equation}
\ord_p(A_1 \dotsm A_{\ell} - \tilde{A}_1 \dotsm \tilde{A}_{\ell}) \geq N.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We can follow the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:productval}, 
observing that, for matrices $A$, $B$ over $\mathbf{Q}_p$, 
we have $\ord_p(A + B) \geq \min \{\ord_p(A), \ord_p(B)\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
Suppose that $K_2, N_2$ are positive integers such that $N_2$ is greater than 
the sum of two or three of $\ord_p(\Phi_0)$, $\ord_p\bigl(C \bmod t^{K_2}\bigr)$, 
and $\ord_p\bigl(C^{-1} \bmod{t^{\ceil{K_2/p}}}\bigr)$.
In order to compute the power series expansion around the origin 
of the matrix~$\Phi$ modulo~$t^{K_2}$ to $p$-adic precision~$N_2$, it 
suffices to compute the matrices $C$, $C^{-1}$ and $\Phi_0$ to 
$p$-adic precision $N_3$, $N_3'$ and $N_4$, respectively, where 
\begin{align*}
N_3  & \geq N_2 + \bigl(2\delta+(n-1)\bigr) \ceil{\log_p \ceil{K_2/p}} + \delta, \\
N_3' & \geq N_2 + \bigl(2\delta+(n-1)\bigr) \ceil{\log_p K_2} + \delta, \\
N_4  & \geq N_2 + \bigl(2\delta+(n-1)\bigr) \bigl(\ceil{\log_p K_2} + \ceil{\log_p \ceil{K_2/p}}\bigr).
\end{align*}
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:matrixproductval}, the bounds 
on the valuations of $C$ and $C^{-1}$ from Theorem~\ref{thm:valC} and 
the bound $\ord_p(\Phi_0) \geq - \delta$ from Lemma~[[TODO: Reference]].
\end{proof}

\section{Analytic continuation and evaluation}
\label{sec:Evaluation}

In the previous section we described how to compute the matrix~$\Phi$ 
for the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ on $\Hrig^{n}(U/S)$ 
as a local power series expansion around $t = 0$.  In order to evaluate it 
at a second point $t = t_1$, we wish to $p$-adically approximate it 
using rational functions with denominators a power of $r(t)$, which 
is possible as the entries of the matrix~$\Phi$ are overconvergent 
functions.

The analytic continuation of the local expansion is described by Lauder 
in~\citep[\S 5.2]{Lauder2006} and the computational details are explained 
in~\citep[\S 8.1]{Lauder2004a}.  Combining this step with the subsequent 
evaluation, our specific problem is the following.  Given a desired 
$p$-adic precision~$N_2$, we would like to determine integers~$K_1$ 
and~$K_2$ such that, modulo~$p^{N_2}$, the entries of the matrix 
$\Psi(t) = r(t)^{K_1} \Phi(t)$ truncated modulo~$t^{K_2}$ allow us to 
compute the matrix $\Phi_{t_1}$ for the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ 
on $\Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$ as $r(\hat{t_1})^{-1} \Psi(\hat{t_1})$.

Besides the work of Lauder~\citep[\S 8.1]{Lauder2004a}, there are also 
suitable results by Gerkmann~\citep[\S 6]{Gerkmann2007}, however the 
estimates are not sharp in practice.  There has been recent progress by 
Kedlaya and Tuitman~\citep[Theorem~2.1]{KedlayaTuitman2012}, which we 
present in a slightly simplified form:

\begin{thm} \label{thm:KedlayaTuitman}
Let $\mathfrak{Z}$ denote the complement of the open dense 
subscheme $\mathfrak{S}$ of $\mathbf{P}^{1}(\mathbf{Q}_q)$ 
and let $z$ be an unramified geometric point of $\mathfrak{Z}$ 
such that $\mathfrak{Z}$ does not contain any other points 
with the same reduction modulo~$p$.  For a fixed a basis for 
$\Hrig^n(U/S)$, suppose that the matrix 
for the connection~$\nabla$ has at most a simple pole at~$z$ 
and that the exponents $\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_{b}$, 
which are defined as the eigenvalues of $(t - z) M \vert_{t=z}$ 
and known to be rational numbers, have non-negative $p$-adic 
valuation.  Then the matrix~$\Phi$ for the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ 
has a pole at $z$ of order at most 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:KedlayaTuitman}
\max_{i} \lambda_i - p \min_{i} \lambda_i + p g(N)
\end{equation}
where $g(N)$ is defined by 
\begin{equation}
g(N) = \max\Bigl\{ i \in \mathbf{N} : i - \delta - \bigl(2\delta + (n-1)\bigr) \ceil{\log_p i} < N \Bigr\}.
\end{equation}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
See \citep[Theorem~2.1]{KedlayaTuitman2012}.
\end{proof}

[[TODO:  Please rewrite the above theorem and include whichever 
form and notation you see fit.]]

\begin{rem} \label{rem:KedlayaTuitman}
In practice, it might be convenient to avoid computing the exponents and 
verifying the hypotheses of the previous theorem.  This is particularly 
relevant since even when the hypotheses are not satisfied, the required 
bounds are often closer to the result of Kedlaya and Tuitman than to the 
estimates provided by Gerkmann.

The contribution of the terms $\max_i \lambda_i - p \min_i \lambda_i$ 
in equation~\eqref{eq:KedlayaTuitman} typically is small compared to the 
term~$p g(N_2)$. Therefore, in a heuristic implementation, one 
could choose e.g.\ $K_1 = 1.1 \times p N_2$ and $K_2 = (\deg(r) + 1) K_1$.
\end{rem}

Having obtained an expression for the action of~$p^{-1} \Frob_p$ 
on~$\Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$ in terms of rational functions, we can 
compute the matrix $\Phi_{t_1}$ representing $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ on 
$\Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$ modulo~$p^{N_2}$ as 
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{t_1} = 
    r(\hat{t}_1)^{-K_1} 
    \Bigl( r(t)^{K_1} \Phi(t) \bmod{t^{K_2}} \Bigr) \Big\vert_{t=\hat{t}_1} \pmod{p^{N_2}}.
\end{equation}
Since, by assumption, $r(t_1)$ is a $p$-adic unit and hence so is 
$r(\hat{t}_1)^{-K_1}$ we observe that it suffices to compute the 
Teichm\"uller lift~$\hat{t}_1$ and the matrix~$r(t)^{K_1} \Phi(t)$ 
over~$\mathbf{Q}_p[t]$ to $p$-adic precision~$N_2$.

\section{Recovering the zeta function of a fiber}
\label{sec:ZetaFunctions}

Recall that the zeta function of the hypersurface~$X_{t_1}$ is of the form,
\begin{equation}
Z(X_{t_1},T) = \frac{p(T)^{(-1)^n}}{(1 - T) (1 - qT) \dotsm (1 - q^{n-1}T)}
\end{equation}
where $p(T) = \det \bigl( 1 - T q^{-1} \Frob_q | \Hrig^n(U_{t_1}) \bigr)$ 
is a polynomial defined over the integers.
Thus, the remaining two steps in the deformation method are now clear.  
Firstly, we determine the action of the $q$th-power Frobenius 
from that of the $p$th-power Frobenius.  Secondly, we compute 
its reverse characteristic polynomial to suitable \mbox{$p$-adic} 
precision in order to recover the zeta function.

\subsection{Computing the action of $q^{-1} \Frob_q$ on $\Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$}

As before, let $\Phi_{t_1}$ and $\Phi_{t_1}^{(q)}$ denote the matrices 
representing the actions of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ and $q^{-1} \Frob_q$ 
on~$\Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$, respectively.  As the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ 
is $\sigma$-semilinear, we have that 
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{t_1}^{(q)} = 
    \Phi_{t_1} \sigma(\Phi_{t_1}) \dotsm \sigma^{a-1}(\Phi_{t_1}),
\end{equation}
where $a = \log_p q$.  Note that the lift of Frobenius~$\sigma$ 
is valuation preserving and hence the valuations of the matrices 
$\Phi_{t_1}, \sigma(\Phi_{t_1}), \dotsc, \sigma^{a-1}(\Phi_{t_1})$ 
are at least $-\delta$ by [[TODO: Reference]].
In particular, it follows that in order to determine $\Phi_{t_1}^{(q)}$ 
to $p$-adic precision~$N_1$ it suffices to provide $\Phi_{t_1}$ to 
precision $N_2 \geq N_1 + (a-1) \delta$.

\subsection{Computing Weil polynomials}

Before considering Weil polynomials, we briefly address the loss 
of precision when computing the reverse characteristic polynomial 
$\det(1 - t A)$ of a $b \times b$ matrix~$A$ given to finite precision 
over $\mathbf{Q}_p$.  In general, from the elementary definition of the 
determinant function, it appears that the precision loss could be as 
great as $(b-1) \ord_p(A)$.  However, in the case of matrices representing 
the action of Frobenius on $\Hrig^n(U_{t_1})$, much better bounds are 
available:

\begin{lem}
Define $\delta = \delta(n,p)$ as in Lemma~[[TODO: Reference]] and 
suppose that $\tilde{\Phi}_{t_1}^{(q)}$ is an approximation to 
$\Phi_{t_1}^{(q)}$ with 
$\ord_p\bigl(\Phi_{t_1}^{(q)}-\tilde{\Phi}_{t_1}^{(q)}\bigr) \geq N + \delta$.
Then 
\begin{equation}
\ord_p \Bigl( \det\bigl(1 - t \Phi_{t_1}^{(q)}\bigr) 
            - \det\bigl(1 - t \tilde{\Phi}_{t_1}^{(q)}\bigr) \Bigr) \geq N.
\end{equation}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} 
See Gerkmann~\citep[Lemma~3.3, Lemma~3.4]{Gerkmann2007}.
\end{proof}

The previous lemma allows us to take $N_1 = N_0 + \delta$ in our 
description of the deformation algorithm.

Finally, we compute the 
reverse characteristic polynomial $p(T)$ of the matrix $\Phi_{t_1}^{(q)}$, 
which represents $q^{-1} \Frob_q$ on $\Hrig^n(U_{t_1})$, to some finite 
$p$-adic precision.  Which precision~$N_0$ is necessary in order to 
correctly recover the polynomial~$p(T)$ over the integers?

\begin{thm} \label{thm:N0}
In order to recover $p(T)$ over $\mathbf{Z}$ it suffices to compute 
an approximation modulo~$p^N$ where 
\begin{equation}
p^N > 2 \max_{0 \leq i \leq b} \binom{b}{i} q^{i (n-1) / 2}.
\end{equation}
Moreover, this can be improved to 
\begin{equation}
p^N > 2 \binom{b}{\floor{b/2}} q^{\floor{b/2} (n-1) / 2}
\end{equation}
provided that the sign $\epsilon = \sgn(\det(F_q))$ of the 
functional equation for the zeta function is known.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
This is a slight reformulation of {Theorem~3.2} in~\citep{Gerkmann2007}, 
which follows readily from its proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
We observe that the sign $\epsilon = \sgn(\det(q^{-1} \Frob_q)) = 1$ 
whenever $n$ is even.  [[TODO: Give justification.  If nothing else, 
include this in the statement of the Weil conjectures.]]
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
In the case that $n$ is odd, the sign~$\epsilon$ of the functional 
equation is unknown a priori.  However, in practice it is often still 
possible to avoid having to use the greater of the two precisions in 
Theorem~\ref{thm:N0} by just computing one additional coefficient 
exactly.  Writing $p(T) = \sum_{i=0}^{b} a_i T^i$, we can recover 
$a_0, \dotsc, a_{\floor{b/2}+1}$ exactly provided 
\begin{equation}
p^N > 2 \max\biggl\{\binom{b}{\floor{b/2}} q^{\floor{b/2} (n-1) / 2}, 
                   \binom{b}{\floor{b/2}+1} q^{(\floor{b/2}+1) (n-1)/2} \biggr\}.
\end{equation}
This allows us to determine the sign~$\epsilon$ from the two 
coefficients $a_{\ceil{b/2}-1}$ and $a_{\floor{b/2}+1}$, provided 
that they are non-zero, and we can then recover the remaining 
coefficients using the functional equation.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem} \label{rem:N0Surfaces}
In the case of smooth projective surfaces, when $p > 2$ and subject to 
certain technical conditions, we can often exploit the growing divisibility 
of the coefficients of $p(T)$ ensured by the Hodge polygon.  For such a surface 
of degree~$d$, we know that the Hodge numbers $h_{0,2}$, $h_{1,1}$ and $h_{2,0}$ 
satisfy $h_{0,2} = h_{2,0} = \binom{d-1}{3}$ and $2 h_{0,2} + h_{1,1} = b$. 
It is now easier to determine the integer coefficients of the 
polynomial~$q^{h_{0,2}} p(T/q)$ as the roots of the polynomial $p(T/q)$ lie 
on the unit circle.  This allows us to take 
\begin{align*}
N_0 & = a h_{0,2} + \floor{\log_p \biggl( 2 \binom{b}{\floor{b/2}}\biggr)} + 1,\\
N_1 & = N_0 + a,
\end{align*}
where $N_0$ here refers to the required precision for $q^{h_{0,2}} p(T/q)$ 
and $N_1$ as before refers to the precision required for the matrix 
representing $q^{-1} \Frob_q$ on $\Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$.
For further details, we refer the reader to 
Lauder~\citep[\S 9.3.2, Proposition~9.6]{Lauder2006}.

\section{The algorithm}
\label{sec:Algorithm}

\subsection{Overview of the algorithm}

We now provide an outline of the deformation method.  The list below 
includes nearly full details of the computation, omitting only the 
specific choices of precisions $N_1, \dotsc, N_7$
and $K_1, K_2$. These will be provided and justified later.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[Step~$\Rmnum{1}$.]
Compute the matrix $\Phi_0 \in M_{b \times b}(\mathbf{Q}_q)$ for the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ on 
$\Hrig^{n}(U_0)$ with respect to the standard basis to $p$-adic precision~$N_1$.  
\item[Step~$\Rmnum{2}$.]
Compute the matrix $M \in M_{b \times b}(\mathbf{Q}_q(t))$ of the Gauss-Manin connection $\nabla$ on 
$\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}_L)$ 
with respect to the standard basis to $p$-adic precision~$N_2$.
\item[Step~$\Rmnum{3}$.]
Let $C \in M_{b \times b} (\mathbf{Q}_q[[t]])$ denote the matrix of local solutions of the connection $\nabla$ around zero i.e., 
the matrix that satisfies the $p$-adic differential equation $\bigl(\tfrac{d}{dt} + M\bigr) C = 0$ with
initial condition $C(0)=I$.  We compute an approximation for the matrices~$C$ and~$C^{\sigma}(t^p)^{-1}$
modulo~$t^{K_1}$ to $p$-adic precision~$N_3$.
\item[Step~$\Rmnum{4}$.]
Let $\Phi(t) \in M_{b \times b}(\mathbf{Q}_p\langle t,r(t)^{-1}\rangle^{\dagger})$ denote the matrix for the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ on 
$\Hrig^{n}(U/S)$ with respect to the standard basis (which is only a basis generically). One can show that 
this matrix satisfies $\Phi(t) = C(t) \Phi_0 C^{\sigma}(t^p)^{-1}$.  
Using this formula we compute a power series approximation of $\Phi(t)$ modulo~$t^{K_1}$ to $p$-adic precision~$N_4$.
\item[Step~$\Rmnum{5}$.]
Let $\Phi_{t_1} \in M_{b \times b}(\mathbf{Q}_q)$ denote the matrix for the action of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ 
on $\Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$. First we compute $\Psi(t) = r(t)^{K_2} \Phi(t)$ modulo~$t^{K_1}$ to $p$-adic precision~$N_5$.  Then we compute  
an approximation $r(\hat{t}_1)^{-K_1} \Psi(\hat{t}_1)$ for $\Phi_{t_1}$ to $p$-adic precision~$N_5$.
\item[Step~$\Rmnum{6}$.]
Let $\Phi_{t_1}^{(q^m)}$ denote the matrix for the action of $q^{-m} \Frob_{q^m}$ on 
$\Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$, which satisfies 
$\Phi_{t_1}^{(q^m)} = \Phi_{t_1} \sigma(\Phi_{t_1}) \dotsm \sigma^{a-1}(\Phi_{t_1})$ 
and has entries in $\mathbf{Q}_{q^m}$.  We compute an approximation to this matrix with $p$-adic precision~$N_6$.
%TODO change notation for q^m power Frobenius matrix, looks like power of matrix
\item[Step~$\Rmnum{7}$.]
Let $p(T) = \det\bigl(1 - T (q^m)^{-1} \Frob_{q^m} | \Hrig^n(U_{t_1})\bigr)$, 
which is an integer polynomial.  We recover this exactly 
by computing an approximation to the reverse characteristic polynomial 
of $\Phi_{t_1}^{(q^m)}$ to $p$-adic precision~$N_7$.

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:Examples}

\subsection{Parallelisation}

From a practical point of view, we observe that the individual steps 
of the algorithm which contribute significantly to the runtime can be 
carried out in parallel:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the implementation of the computation of $p^{-1} \Frob_p$ 
      on $\Hrig^{n}(U_0)$ which is quasi-cubic in the precision, 
      the elements of the sequence $(\mu_m)_{m=0}^{M}$ can be computed 
      independently.
\item The computation of the connection matrix can be parallelised 
      as the computations of the images of the basis vectors for 
      $\HdR^{n}(\mathfrak{U}/\mathfrak{S})$ are independent.
\item The major contributor to the runtime in many examples is the 
      computation of the matrix~$C(t)$ which is the local solution 
      of the differential equation.  While the outer loop in 
      Equation~[[TODO: Reference]] cannot be parallelised easily 
      as $C_{i}$ depends on certain $C_{j}$ with $j < i$, the 
      matrix products in the inner loop are independent.
\item The computation of the $q$th-power Frobenius 
      $\Phi^{(q)} \sigma(\Phi^{(q)}) \dotsm \sigma^{a-1}(\Phi^{(q)})$, 
      where $a = \log_{p} q$, can be carried out in parallel.  This can 
      be achieved if, instead of computing a running product from left to 
      right, we express the matrix in a product tree.  We formalise this in 
      Algorithm~\ref{alg:ParallelProduct}, assuming for simplicity 
      that $a = 2^k$.  In this notation, the execution of the 
      loops indexed by~$i$ can be parallelised.
      \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{Parallel computation of $q^{-1} \Frob_{q} | \Hrig^{n}(U_{t_1})$}

      \vspace{1mm}
      \For{$i \gets 0$ \textbf{to} $a-1$}
          \State $G_i \gets \sigma^{i}(F)$
      \EndFor
      \For{$j=k-1$ \textbf{to} $0$}
          \State $h \gets 2^{k-j}$
          \For{$i \gets 0$ \textbf{to} $2^j-1$}
          \State $G_{2^j-1 + ih} \gets G_{2^j-1 + i h} G_{2^j-1 + ih + h/2}$
          \EndFor
      \EndFor
      \Return $G_0$
      \end{algorithmic}
      \end{algorithm}
\end{itemize}
